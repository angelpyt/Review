# Review
1. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc.)? If so, please list who.
Professor

2. Did you complete any advanced extensions to this challenge? If so, what?
I did Authentication and Authorization. But I failed to display the username part in the review, as well as verify userID. I'm sure that I defined user previously, but console kept showing it is undefined. So I didn't finish it. 

3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?
30 hours

4. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?
display stars is a hard part. After that, I think everything's fine.
